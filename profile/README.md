# BnjmnRsh Projects

👋🏼  This is [my home](https://github.com/bnjmnrsh) for demos, tests and follies, where I often [dog food my own tools](https://github.com/bnjmnrsh). 

Don't be fooled; each is designed to take me one step closer to a career in Tech. ✨

This isn't my first rodeo, and I've picked up some excellent transferable skills from the creative industries along the way, which might be attractive to the right team. I'm currently seeking part-time, or project-based roles, and would love to chat: bnjmnrsh@gmail.com.
